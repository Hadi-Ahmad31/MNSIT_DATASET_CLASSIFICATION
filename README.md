# MNSIT_DATASET_CLASSIFICATION
This is a project repo for my internship at ARCH_Technologies where i was required to use machine learning classification in order to allow the model to correctly predict the number it sees in front of it. The data is hosted on a web app through streamlit and the code for both the model and streamlit app is included in the singular jupyter notebook file
